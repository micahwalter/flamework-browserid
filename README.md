flamework-browserid
=========

Drop in libraries to use a BrowserID server for account validation in Flamework
projects.

STOP NOW
=========

This is still experimental.

If you are reading this it means I've gotten as far making the basic signin and
validation flow work but I have *not* actually read the spec or thought through
all the security bits.

If you're comfortable with Flamework projects and considering the many still
pointy edges that may remain knock yourself out. Otherwise, it's probably best
to wait before using this.
